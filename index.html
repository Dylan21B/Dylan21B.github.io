    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p> Hello! My name is Dylan Butzler and I was proudly born and raised in Nashville, TN. I first became interested in computers when I was a young man. I was introduced to Adobe Photoshop when I was a sophmore in High School, and it quickly became 
        my favorite class. My teacher and mentor, Joe Burlingame, taught me the ins and outs of Photoshop and really helped me grasp the main concepts. I still have much
        to learn in terms of Photoshop, but i continue to learn and grow my skills. My teacher was also the one who introduced me to HTML and CSS. After High School, I worked and attended college until 
        I found Nashville Software Scool. I was imiediatly drawn to the challenge and skills that NSS had to offer. I now attend NSS and I am loving evry second of it. I stil have alot to learn and 
        open to any new knowledge.   </p>
